configuration:
  scripts:
    name: Scripts
    description: >-
      A list of filenames of scripts you wish to run.
      Optionally provide a path: with trailing slash eg. /share/mynetworkshare/
  threads:
    name: Throttle/Thread Limit
    description: >-
      The thread limit for the number of jobs to be launched. Threading is
      handled automatically with jobs/scripts waiting for a slot when you want 
      to run more scripts than the set Throttle Limit.
      Ensure you don't set all your scripts to run in infinite loops or some
      may never run if there are inadequate threads available.
